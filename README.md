# Activity12-Recursions

Task 1: Identify the base case in the function:

def print_every_other(low, high)
    return if low > high  
    puts low
    print_every_other(low + 2, high)
end

Base case: return if low > high;

Task 2: My kid was playing with my computer and changed my factorial function so that it computes factorial based on (n - 2) instead of (n - 1). Predict what will happen when we run 
factorial(10) using this function:

def factorial(n)
    return 1 if n == 1
    return n * factorial(n - 2)
end

factorial(0) → factorial(-2) → factorial(-4) → ...

Task 3: Following is a function in which we pass in two numbers called low and high. The function returns the sum of all the numbers from low to high. For example, if low is 1, and 
high is 10, the function will return the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10, which is 55. However, our code is missing the base case, and will run indefinitely! Fix the code by adding the 
correct base case:

def sum(low, high)
    return high + sum(low, high - 1)
end

Correct version: 

int sum(int low, int high) {
    if (high < low) return 0;   
    return high + sum(low, high - 1);
}


Task 4: Here is an array containing both numbers as well as other arrays, which in turn contain numbers and arrays:

array=[ 1, 
        2, 
        3,
        [4, 5, 6],
        7,
        [8,
          [9, 10, 11,
            [12, 13, 14]
          ] 
        ],
        [15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
          [20, 21, 22,
            [23, 24, 25,
              [26, 27, 29]
            ], 30, 31 
          ], 32
        ], 33 
      ]
      
  Write a recursive function that prints all the numbers (and just numbers).

void print_numbers(const vector<any>& arr) {
    for (const any& item : arr) {
        if (item.type() == typeid(int)) {
            cout << any_cast<int>(item) << endl;
        } else {
            print_numbers(any_cast<vector<any>>(item));
        }
    }
}
